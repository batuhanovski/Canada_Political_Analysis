## Description

Briefly describe the purpose and goals of your project here.

## Questions Answered

This project aims to answer the following questions:

1. What are the main topics discussed between 1900 and 1939?
2. What topics are the Prime Minister and the opposition talking about?
3. Is there a correlation between electoral performance and the most frequently discussed topic of each Parliamentarian?

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `analysis` folder: Contains Jupyter notebooks and data files.
  - `main.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
  - `helper.ipynb`: Helper Jupyter notebook for web scraping.
  - `speeches` folder: Contains individual CSV files for each year's speeches.
- Data Files:
  - `cleaned_df_nlp.csv`: Preprocessed speech data with cleaned text for NLP.
  - `removed_stopwords.csv`: Speech data with stopwords removed.
  - `sampled_df.csv`: Sampled speech data for sentiment analysis.
  - `frequency_df.csv`: Frequency of most used words in speech data.
